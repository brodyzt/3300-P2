        On this graph you are able to search for games and view both information about those games and other games
        similar to the selected game. The selected game will appear as the only completely white circle on the map.
        Clicking on a game circle will make that become the selected game.

        One trend to notice is related games form clusters in regard to genre. Unsurprisingly, games that are similar
        are generally from the same genre with the occasional game coming from a different genre.
