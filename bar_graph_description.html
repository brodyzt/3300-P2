        a category will be highlighted both on the graph itself and within the legend. This tool can be used to
        analyze
        the trend of a specific category.

        Some major trends to note are that platforms typically go from 0 share to their peak and back to 0 again with 8
        years. The set of platforms each publisher develops for also varies greatly with some publishers not releasing
        any games except for a select few platforms.

        One example of this is that neither Sony nor Nintendo have developed a single game for the XBox 360 since it is
        made by their competitor, Microsoft.
